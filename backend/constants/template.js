	PRODUCT_CHARACTERISTICS: 'New color asfalt with advanced features. Color plays an essential role in our daily lives,' +
		' affecting everything from our emotions to the way we perceive the world.' +
		' Vibrant colors like red and yellow are often associated with energy and' +
		' excitement, while cooler shades like blue and green are known for their ' +
		'calming effects. The psychological impact of color is profound,' +
		' influencing our mood and decision-making in subtle ways. ' +
		'Designers use this knowledge to create environments and ' +
		'products that evoke specific feelings, whether it\'s the soothing' +
		' tones of nature-inspired greens or the bold, attention-grabbing' +
		' power of bright hues.\n' +
		'\n' +
		'Every color carries its own meaning and symbolism, rooted in both ' +
		'culture and biology. For instance, the color blue is often linked' +
		' to tranquility and trustworthiness, making it a popular choice for' +
		' corporate brands and uniforms. On the other hand, purple, historically' +
		' associated with royalty and luxury, is seen as a color of creativity ' +
		'and spirituality. Whether it\'s the rich warmth of autumn oranges or ' +
		'the icy chill of winter whites, color not only beautifies but also ' +
		'serves as a tool for communication, helping us express our personalities ' +
		'and preferences without saying a word.',
